os2execd.exe    OS/2 program which receives requests from DOS programs
makefile        Makefile for compiling the two programs


os2exec and os2execd are copyright (c) 1992-1993 by Eberhard Mattes.
All rights are reserved.  Copying of these files is authorized only if
(1) you are Eberhard Mattes, or if
(2) you make absolutely no changes to your copy, or
(3) you rename os2execd and os2exec and change the name of the named
    pipe to something different from \pipe\os2exec.em

These restrictions are required to ensure that existing applications
continue to work if you change os2execd.


Usage:

Run

  os2execd

in a OS/2 session.  The following command line options are available:

  -s  switch windows (make the os2execd session active when executing
      a command, switch back after executing the command)

  -v  verbose mode (display information for debugging)


Type

  os2exec <command>

in a DOS session to let os2execd execute the OS/2 command <command> by
invoking CMD.EXE.  All environment variables with the exception of
COMSPEC, PROMPT and PATH are passed to the OS/2 session.  If you
precede <command> with -x, CMD.EXE is not called and the program is
executed directly instead.

Type

  os2exec -q

in a DOS session to make os2execd quit.


If one os2execd is running, only one DOS program at a time can connect
to os2execd.  To allow for more DOS programs connecting to os2execd,
run multiple instances of os2execd.


If you want to write a DOS program which uses os2execd, here's what
you have to do:

  - open a file named \pipe\os2exec.em in read/write mode

  - send messages

  - wait for response

  - close the file

Messages start with two bytes indicating the length of the message.
These two bytes are not included in the length.  The low-order byte of
the length is sent first.

The third byte of a message is a command character.  The following
commands are available:

  A  Acknowledge for return code

  Q  Stop os2execd.  You should wait for acknowledge before closing
     the file

  C  Execute command by CMD.EXE: command

  E  Send environment variable: name=value

  X  Execute command directly: command

  W  Set working directory: directory or d:directory

Starting at the forth byte the argument (see list above, the command
is shown after the colon) should be sent.

os2execd sends back a response for the C and X commands using the same
length/command/arguments format.  The following command bytes are
defined:

  A  Acknowledge for Q command

  R  Program executed: return code (or -1 if failed)
